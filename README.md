# car-rental-system
I have created a simple Vehicle Rental System using Java. This code contains inheritance, object creation and method overriding.

# Summary:
We have a class hierarchy with a base class called Vehicle and three subclasses: Car, Motorcycle, and Truck. Each vehicle type will have its unique attributes and methods. Additionally, we'll create a RentalSystem class to manage rental operations, allowing users to rent and return vehicles while calculating rental costs. Comments are added to respective line of codes for easy understanding.
